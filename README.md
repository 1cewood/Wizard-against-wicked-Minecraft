By using the currency of the ancient war, players can purchase a variety of useful supplies in the store, while the store will also recover the player's handmade goods in exchange for coins.
Of course, you can also choose to stay in the Lord's world or any world you like. Stevie mine cars, ancient war automation and a range of building materials and vehicle mods can make your life more exciting.
